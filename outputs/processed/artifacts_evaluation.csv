2025-11-04T20:08:30.491473+00:00,5.1.1,,Correct,Norway's traditional guarantee (minstepensjon/garantipensjon) and the historic normal retirement age for alderspensjon has been 67 years. Reforms introduced after 2011 made retirement flexible (allowing pension take-up from age 62) and introduced a life-expectancy-linked normative pension age for younger cohorts — but the guarantee pension remains payable from age 67. This is consistent with NAV guidance and the Norwegian government explanation of pension reforms.

That was true under the older rules, but Norway completed further pension reforms in 2024–2025 that replace the fixed age of 67 for younger cohorts with a life‑expectancy‑linked 'standard retirement age' and gradual increases for people born in/after 1963/1964. Authoritative summaries (SSA International Update Nov 2024) and recent Norwegian/industry guidance (Tekna) describe the new life‑expectancy adjustments and that flexible drawing from age 62 remains possible.

2025-11-04T20:09:01.525498+00:00,5.2.1,,Insufficient Evidence,"The AI answer correctly identifies § 15-13a of the Working Environment Act (Arbeidsmiljøloven) as the statutory provision establishing an age‑based termination right and correctly states the general age limit is 72 years. However the answer omits recent legislative changes (2025) that remove the employer’s ability to set company‑specific lower age limits and harmonise the public‑sector age limit to 72 from 1 January 2026.

However, the Norwegian government has adopted amendments that will abolish the company-specific 70-year exception so that, from 1 January 2026, the general age limit of 72 will be the standard in most workplaces; only health-and-safety-based lower limits will remain possible.
